********* Generating Report by TestNG ***********

--> To generate report we have to use the keyword
	Reporter.log(" ", True);

--> Here Inside the (" Cotation ") we can write the message which wants to print
--> And it the Boolean value makes "true" that message will print on the Console also
--> If makes "false", will print in the report output only


Class Code: 


	@Test
	public void test1() throws InterruptedException {
		
	// **** Here Below just making a String and print in the Reoprt and console as well *********

		Reporter.log("Visiting the google website and printing it's title", false);
		
		WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
		driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("https://www.google.com/");
		String title = driver.getTitle();
	
	// ***** Here showing the title we found from the website and print in the Reoprt and console as well *******
	
		Reporter.log("Current Website Title is: "+ title, true);
		
		Thread.sleep(2000);
		driver.close();
	}





--> For seeing the report, we will have to refresh the "Maven Project"
--> Go to "Test-Output" file
--> Go to "index.html" it will be opened on browser
	--> Click on "Reporter Output"
--> Ye can see the Email Able Report from "emailable-report.html" file
